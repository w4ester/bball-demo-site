# Basketball — Website (Demo-Ready)

This is a **demo** to show how a modern, mobile‑first site can reduce volunteer email load and help families find what they need quickly.

## What’s Included
- Responsive homepage with clear calls‑to‑action
- **New** onboarding page
- Searchable **FAQs**
- Programs overview
- Simple season **Calendar**
- **Coaches** and **Sponsors** pages
- Accessible, fast, and easy to maintain (plain HTML/CSS/JS)

## Quick Start (Local)
1. Download and unzip.  
2. Double‑click `index.html` to open in your browser.

## Demo (5 minutes)

## Make
- Update colors in `assets/styles.css` under `:root { --brand-* }`.
- Replace `registration.html` with your live portal wording and ensure the Register buttons point to the correct page.
- Replace all placeholder text with **official** program content and policies.
- Swap in your logo file at `assets/logo.svg` (or keep the placeholder).

## Notes
- The **placement helper** uses Sept 1, 2025 as the cut‑off and is for guidance only. Adjust rules in `assets/script.js`.
- This demo avoids external dependencies (fast and simple to maintain). You can later add analytics or calendar integrations as needed.
